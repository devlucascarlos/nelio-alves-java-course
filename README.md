# ☕ Java Course & Software Engineering

Welcome to my central repository for Java development. This project documents my intensive journey through **Nélio Alves' Complete Java Course**, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures, and Enterprise Application Development.

## 🎯 Goal
To master the Java ecosystem—from syntax fundamentals to building scalable Web Services with **Spring Boot**—applying clean code principles and best practices.

## 📚 Study Roadmap & Progress

Based on the official syllabus, I have organized my progress into logical modules:

| Status | Module | Key Concepts Focus |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 🟢 | **Java Core & Logic** | Variables, Control Flow, Debugging, Clean Syntax |
| 🔴 | **OOP Fundamentals** | Classes, Attributes, Methods, `static`, Constructors, Encapsulation |
| 🔴 | **Memory & Arrays** | Stack vs. Heap, Garbage Collector, Lists, Boxing/Unboxing |
| 🔴 | **Advanced OOP** | Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Exception Handling |
| 🔴 | **♟️ PROJECT: Chess System** | Complex Logic, Matrix manipulation, Layered Architecture |
| 🔴 | **Functional Java** | Lambdas, Stream API, Pipelines, File Handling |
| 🔴 | **Database Integration** | JDBC, SQL Fundamentals, DAO Pattern |
| 🔴 | **Interface & GUI** | JavaFX, Event Handling, Desktop Application Build |
| 🔴 | **🚀 ENTERPRISE: Spring Boot** | REST API, JPA/Hibernate, Dependency Injection, Maven |
| 🔴 | **NoSQL & MongoDB** | Document-oriented databases, Spring Data Mongo |

*(Legend: 🟢 Completed | 🟡 In Progress | 🔴 Future)*

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
* **Language:** Java 21 (LTS)
* **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, Hibernate, JavaFX
* **Databases:** MySQL, H2, MongoDB
* **Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Git/GitHub, Maven, Postman

## 📂 Project Structure
This repository will evolve to contain multiple sub-projects and exercises.
- `/src`: Core logic and algorithm exercises.
- `(Future Repos)`: The **Chess System** and **Spring API** will be linked here as separate detailed repositories.
